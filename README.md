Assignment 3 – Minimum Spanning Tree Report
by Abushemenov Alisher
1. Summary of Input Data and Algorithm Results
This project focused on finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for several graphs of different sizes and densities using Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms. Each graph represents a transportation network, and the goal is to connect all vertices (districts) with minimum total cost.

The algorithms were implemented in Java using classes: Graph.java, Edge.java, PrimMST.java, KruskalMST.java, UnionFind.java, and MSTSolver.java.
Graph ID	Vertices	Edges	Prim Total Cost	Kruskal Total Cost	Prim Ops	Kruskal Ops	Prim Time (ms)	Kruskal Time (ms)
1	5	6	16.0	16.0	35	32	0.8	1.36
2	6	8	15.0	15.0	48	51	0.1	0.08
3	10	12	30.0	30.0	72	77	0.09	0.08
4	12	15	41.0	41.0	89	99	0.18	0.12
5	20	22	67.0	67.0	132	167	0.2	0.14
6	25	28	92.0	92.0	167	212	0.21	0.15

For all graphs, both algorithms produced the same MST total cost, confirming that both are correct. The operation counts show that Kruskal’s algorithm required fewer operations on small graphs, while Prim’s algorithm became more efficient as the graphs grew denser.
2. Comparison Between Prim’s and Kruskal’s Algorithms
Theory
Prim’s algorithm builds the MST by starting from a single vertex and repeatedly adding the smallest edge that connects a new vertex. It is efficient for dense graphs because it uses a priority queue (heap) to manage edges.
Kruskal’s algorithm sorts all edges by weight and adds them one by one, skipping edges that would form a cycle. It uses the Union-Find structure to detect cycles, making it efficient for sparse graphs.
Aspect	Prim’s Algorithm	Kruskal’s Algorithm
Approach	Grows MST from one node	Adds smallest edges globally
Data Structure	Priority Queue	Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
Best for	Dense graphs	Sparse graphs
Time Complexity	O(E log V)	O(E log E) ≈ O(E log V)
Implementation	Slightly more complex	Easier to implement

In Practice

From the experiments:
- On small and medium graphs, both algorithms performed almost equally fast, since the number of edges was not large.
- On larger and denser graphs, Prim’s algorithm required fewer operations, because it continuously grows one connected component instead of sorting all edges.
- Kruskal’s algorithm required more operations on dense graphs due to additional Union-Find checks.

However, for sparse graphs with few edges, Kruskal remains simple and fast.
3. Conclusions
Both Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms produce the same MST cost and structure for all connected graphs. The difference lies in their efficiency depending on graph density:

- Prim’s algorithm is better for dense graphs because it does not need to process every edge globally.
- Kruskal’s algorithm is better for sparse graphs because sorting a smaller edge list is faster.
- In real-world transportation networks (usually sparse), Kruskal’s algorithm may be slightly more practical, while Prim’s scales better for dense, interconnected networks.

In conclusion, both algorithms are correct and effective, but their performance depends on the type of graph and implementation details.
